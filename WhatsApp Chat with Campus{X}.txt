13/03/24, 7:23 pm - Poonam Mam apsit: PBL review for remaining groups will be conducted tomorrow at 5:00pm
14/03/24, 6:15 am - Anagha Mam: It seems few students are not at all serious about the Pre Placement Training Going On Currently. It's observed that through surveillance that they come late,  seems distracted in during training, using mobile phones  during  training.  It is also observed that few students they don't even attempt coding tasks given during training & just place themselves in listening mode which is also serious. 

One thing students will have to understand that after training they will heve to go through assessment tests. If assessment is not cleared then unfortunately we can't include these students in placement activities untill they reach to certain level. 


So Don't do Pre Placement training for sake of attendance  neither take this training as regular Academic Activity. 

As a mentor we can only suggest rest depends on your approach & attitude you will carry in such training programs.
