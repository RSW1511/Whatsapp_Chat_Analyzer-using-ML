Do payments through payment modes available through Institute payment portal only not through any other methods to avoid real time reflection of your fees payment on Institute Payment portal which will be referred by Department.

One thing students will have to understand that after training they will heve to go through assessment tests. If assessment is not cleared then unfortunately we can't include these students in placement activities untill they reach to certain level. 


So Don't do Pre Placement training for sake of attendance  neither take this training as regular Academic Activity. 

As a mentor we can only suggest rest depends on your approach & attitude you will carry in such training programs.
